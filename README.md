# Introduction

This project uses the Weight Lifting Exercise dataset from research done regarding human activity recognition.[1]  The researchers write the following in their abstract:

- "Research on activity recognition has traditionally focused
on discriminating between different activities, i.e. to predict
_which_ activity was performed at a specific point in time.
The quality of executing an activity, the _how (well)_, has
only received little attention so far, even though it potentially
provides useful information for a large variety of applications."

In their experiment, they used sensors placed on the glove, arm, belt, and asked participants to do certain weightlifting exercises first, with flawless technique, and then subsequently in various incorrect ways.

My prediction algorithm is built on this data.  If given sensor information from a new participant, my algorithm tells the user whether or not they are doing the exercize correctly, or if they are doing it incorrectly, in what way they are doing it incorrectly.
